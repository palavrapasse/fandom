Because fans tend to fake leaks

In this repository you can find a public database generated with fake records using [mockaroo](https://www.mockaroo.com/). For association tables, we have mixed records to promote data diversity in attempt to make the database feel real and close to reality.

Play around with this database in a development environent. You can also use it to assess SQLite performance.
